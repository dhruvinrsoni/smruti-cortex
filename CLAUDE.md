## Common Commands

**Develop:**

| Command | Purpose | Speed |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `npm run build` | Dev build (source maps) | ~10s |
| `npm run build:prod` | Production build (minified) | ~30s |
| `npm run start:watch` | Watch mode (rebuild on file save) | continuous |

**Test:**

| Command | Purpose | Speed |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `npm test` | Unit tests (1,233+ tests, 46 files) | ~60s |
| `npm run test:watch` | Unit tests in watch mode | continuous |
| `npm run coverage` | Unit tests + v8 coverage report | ~30s |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Build + E2E tests (45 tests, 7 specs) | ~90s |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint check (errors block, warnings inform) | ~5s |
| `npm run lint:strict` | ESLint zero-warning check (manual cleanup use) | ~5s |

**Ship:**

| Command | Purpose | Speed |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `npm run verify` | Full verification (lint + builds + tests, reports at end) | ~4min |
| `npm run preflight` | Verify + prod release validations | ~6min |
| `npm run release:patch` | Full release pipeline (patch bump) | ~60s |
| `npm run release:minor` | Full release pipeline (minor bump) | ~60s |
| `npm run release:major` | Full release pipeline (major bump) | ~60s |
| `npm run store-prep` | Print Chrome Web Store submission text | instant |
| `npm run store:check` | Verify store submission doc exists for current version | instant |

**Tips:**
- Append `-- --dry-run` to any release command to preview without pushing.
- Append `-- --no-e2e` to verify to skip E2E tests, or `-- --e2e-slowmo` for visual debugging.
- Run `npm run publish:coverage` after `npm run coverage` to publish the report to GitHub Pages.
- Pre-commit hook runs build+test+coverage automatically. Override with `FORCE_PRE_COMMIT=1`.

## Scripts Quick Reference

Quick-reference for when you come back after 6 months.

### Verification & Release Pipeline

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run verify` | Runs lint, dev build, prod build, unit tests (with coverage), E2E tests. Runs ALL steps even if one fails, reports at end. Flags: `--no-e2e`, `--e2e-slowmo`. |
| `npm run preflight` | Runs verify, then checks version sync, manifest MV3 validation, dist/ integrity, package zip, git status. "Cleared for takeoff?" check. |
| `npm run release:patch\|minor\|major` | Full release: preflight, bump, changelog, commit, tag, push, GitHub Release, zip. Append `-- --dry-run` to preview. |
| `npm run store-prep` | Prints "What's New", permission justifications, privacy summary for Chrome Web Store submission form. |
| `npm run store:check` | Verifies `docs/store-submissions/vX.Y.Z-chrome-web-store.md` exists for the current version. Use `--init` to scaffold it. |

### Version Syncing

`package.json` is the single source of truth for version numbers. Two mechanisms keep `manifest.json` in sync:
- **Tier 3 (npm lifecycle):** `npm version patch/minor/major` triggers the `version` hook which calls `sync-version.mjs` and stages `manifest.json`.
- **Tier 2 (build-time fallback):** `sync-version.mjs` runs at the start of every `build` and `build:prod`, catching any drift.

Quick bump (no full release): `npm version patch` — bumps both files, commits, tags. Does NOT push or create a GitHub Release.

### Pre-commit hook (`scripts/pre-commit-check.js`)

Runs automatically on every `git commit`:
1. Detects staged files — skips if only docs/config changed
2. ESLint auto-fix on staged `.ts` files
3. Build (dev) — blocking
4. Build (prod) — blocking
5. Unit tests with coverage — non-blocking (warns but doesn't block)

Override: `FORCE_PRE_COMMIT=1 git commit ...` to force checks even for docs-only changes.

## Domain Skills (On-Demand Context)

Load `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for deep domain knowledge:

| Skill | Load when... |
|-------|-------------|
| `search-engine` | Changing scorers, tokenizer, or ranking logic |
| `ai-ollama` | Working on AI expansion, embeddings, circuit breaker |
| `ui-components` | Touching popup, quick-search overlay, Shadow DOM |
| `command-palette` | Adding/changing palette commands, prefix modes, web search engines |
| `testing` | Writing or fixing tests |
| `settings` | Changing any setting key, default, or validation |
| `workflows-ci` | Modifying GitHub Actions or Docker |
| `test-generation` | Generating new test files (full rules + mock patterns) |
| `maintenance` | Bug fixes, releases, Chrome Web Store submissions |

Full test generation agent: `.github/copilot/agents/test-coverage-agent.md`

## Efficiency Rules (Repo-Adapted)

### Model / Agent Selection

- **Direct (no agent):** Reading 1-2 known files, single targeted search, making code edits
- **Explore agent:** Understanding how a subsystem works, multi-file pattern discovery
- **Plan agent:** Before implementing non-trivial changes — scorers, settings, search pipeline

### Discovery Strategy

Prefer in this order:
1. **Glob** for file finding: `src/background/search/scorers/*.ts`, `src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts`
2. **Grep `files_with_matches`** to locate which files contain a symbol before reading
3. **Read** with `offset`+`limit` when the relevant region is known from Grep line numbers
4. **Explore agent** only when answer spans many files or requires iteration

### This Repo Specifically

- **Scorers are isolated:** Each scorer in `src/background/search/scorers/` is independent. A change to `title-scorer.ts` won't affect `url-scorer.ts`.
- **Settings schema is truth:** Never hardcode a setting key. Always reference `SETTINGS_SCHEMA` in `src/core/settings.ts`.
- **Logger everywhere:** Use `Logger.forComponent('Name')` — never raw `console.log`.
- **Tests run fast:** `npm test` finishes in ~28s. Always run after code changes before committing.
- **Build is slow:** `npm run build:prod` takes ~30s + pre-commit hook adds another run on commit. Verify logic via `npm test` first.
- **Chrome APIs require mocking:** jsdom has no `chrome.*`. Every test that touches Chrome APIs must mock them. See `.github/skills/testing/SKILL.md` patterns.
- **90%+ line coverage:** 1,233+ unit tests across 46 test files + 45 Playwright E2E tests across 7 spec files. See `.github/copilot/test-generation-instructions.md` for mock patterns.
- **Shared test utilities:** `src/__test-utils__/` provides composable Chrome API mocks, Logger/Settings mocks, data factories, and lifecycle helpers — use these instead of inline mocks.
- **E2E tests need a build:** Playwright loads the built extension from `dist/`. Run `npm run build:prod` before `npx playwright test`. See `docs/E2E_TESTING.md` for fixture architecture and troubleshooting.
- **Underscore-dir guardrail:** Chrome MV3 forbids directories starting with `_` in extensions. `tsconfig.json` excludes `src/**/__test-utils__/**` and `scripts/copy-static.mjs` post-build sweep removes any that leak through.
- **Lint policy:** `npm run lint` — errors block, warnings are advisory (exit 0). Test files have `no-explicit-any` and `no-non-null-assertion` turned off via `.eslintrc.cjs` overrides. `npm run lint:strict` (`--max-warnings 0`) exists for manual cleanup sprints but is **not** wired into verify/preflight/release — no obligation to maintain zero warnings.

### Parallelization

Run in parallel when independent:
- Multiple file reads (use one message with multiple Read calls)
- Multiple Grep/Glob searches
- Multiple Explore agents for different subsystems

---

## Key Conventions

- **TypeScript only** — no new `.js` files in `src/`
- **No `any` without justification** — ESLint warns; fix it
- **Single source of truth** — settings live in `SETTINGS_SCHEMA`, not scattered constants
- **Logger pattern** — `const log = Logger.forComponent('MyModule');`
- **Test location** — `src/<area>/__tests__/<filename>.test.ts` (co-located)
- **No hardcoded versions** — `scripts/sync-version.mjs` syncs `package.json` → `manifest.json`
- **Commit convention** — `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:` prefixes (used by release script for changelog)

## Maintenance Workflows (Claude Code Playbook)

This section is the primary workflow reference for Claude Code sessions. Load `.github/skills/maintenance/SKILL.md` for rollback procedures, manual testing checklists, and Chrome Web Store rejection handling.

### Bug Fix
1. Read the bug report — understand the symptom
2. Use the **Critical File Map** above to locate the relevant source file
3. Load the appropriate **domain skill** if the bug is in a complex area (search, AI, settings)
4. Make the **minimal fix** in `src/` — no refactoring, no unrelated changes
5. Run `npm test` — all 1,233+ unit tests must pass
6. Run `npm run build:prod` — must succeed with zero errors
7. Commit: `git commit -m "fix: <concise description>"`
8. If shipping immediately: `npm run release:patch`

### New Feature
1. Understand the request — check if existing code can be extended
2. Load the relevant **domain skill** from `.github/skills/`
3. Plan the implementation (use Plan agent for non-trivial changes)
4. Implement following existing patterns (Logger, SettingsManager, isolated scorers)
5. Write tests if touching core logic — target 90%+ coverage for new code
6. Run `npm test` and `npm run build:prod`
7. Commit: `git commit -m "feat: <concise description>"`
8. If shipping: `npm run release:minor`

### Release + Chrome Web Store
```bash
npm run release:patch   # or release:minor / release:major
npm run store-prep      # prints: What's New, permissions, privacy summary
```
Then:
1. Create/update `docs/store-submissions/vX.Y.Z-chrome-web-store.md` with full submission fields
2. Commit the submission doc: `git commit -m "docs: add Chrome Web Store submission record for vX.Y.Z"`
3. Upload the submission doc as a GitHub release attachment alongside the zip
4. Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole
5. Upload `release/smruti-cortex-vX.Y.Z.zip`
6. Fill all fields using the submission doc as reference
7. Submit for review

### Security / Dependency Fix
1. Check `npm audit` output — identify the vulnerability
2. Update the dependency in `package.json`
3. Run `npm install` → `npm test` → `npm run build:prod`
4. Commit: `git commit -m "fix: update <pkg> to address <CVE/issue>"`
5. If shipping: `npm run release:patch`

### Quick Patch (no deep context)
1. Grep for the error message or keyword in `src/`
2. Locate the issue using the file map above
3. Fix → `npm test` → commit → optionally release

### Semver
- `patch` — bug fixes, no API change
- `minor` — new features, backward compatible
- `major` — breaking changes
- No bump — `docs:`, `chore:`, `style:`, `test:` commits
