## 📜 Privacy Policy (Required)

### Privacy Policy Content

**SmrutiCortex Privacy Policy**

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026

**1. Data Collection**

SmrutiCortex does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data externally. All data processing happens locally on your device.

**2. What Data is Stored Locally**

The extension stores the following data in your browser's local IndexedDB:
- Browser history URLs (obtained via Chrome History API)
- Page titles
- Visit timestamps
- Optional metadata (keywords, descriptions) extracted from pages you visit

**3. Where Data is Stored**

All data is stored exclusively in:
- Browser IndexedDB (local database)
- Chrome Storage Local API (settings)

**4. Data Transmission**

SmrutiCortex does NOT:
- Send any data to external servers
- Use cloud storage or sync
- Transmit browsing history anywhere
- Include analytics or tracking
- Use third-party services

**5. Data Retention**

Data is stored indefinitely until you:
- Manually clear extension data (via Settings)
- Uninstall the extension (automatic cleanup)
- Clear browser data

**6. User Control**

You have full control to:
- Delete all extension data anytime
- Disable metadata extraction
- Uninstall the extension (removes all data)

**7. Permissions Used**

- `history`: Read browser history for indexing

## 🔒 Permissions Justification

Chrome requires explaining why each permission is needed:

| Permission | Justification |
|------------|---------------|
| `history` | **Required** to read and index browser history for search functionality |
| `bookmarks` | **Required** to index bookmarks for unified search (v6.0) |
| `storage` | **Required** to store settings and indexed data locally for fast search |
| `tabs` | **Required** to query active tab and send messages to content scripts for inline overlay |
| `alarms` | **Required** to keep service worker alive and schedule background indexing updates |
| `<all_urls>` (optional) | **Optional permission** - Users can optionally grant this to enable metadata extraction (page titles, keywords) for improved search relevance. This feature is OFF by default and must be enabled in Settings. The extension works fully without this permission. |

### 🆕 Optional Host Permissions Strategy

**Important:** To comply with Chrome Web Store policies and minimize review time, `<all_urls>` is now an **optional_host_permission** instead of a required permission.

**What this means:**
- ✅ Extension installs **without** asking for broad permissions
- ✅ Core functionality (search history, inline overlay, keyboard shortcuts) works immediately
- ✅ Users can **optionally** grant `<all_urls>` permission in Settings to enable metadata extraction
- ✅ Faster Chrome Store approval (no "Broad Host Permissions" warning)

**User Experience:**
1. Extension installs with minimal permissions (history, bookmarks, storage, tabs, alarms)
2. Search works instantly with browser history data
3. Users can enable "Enhanced Metadata" in Settings (requires granting optional permission)
4. Once granted, extension extracts titles/keywords from visited pages for better search

**Implementation:**
- Metadata extraction feature is disabled by default
- Settings page shows "Enable Enhanced Metadata" toggle
- Clicking toggle requests optional host permission via `chrome.permissions.request()`
- If denied, extension continues working with basic history data
