Create a Chrome extension icon set for "SmrutiCortex" - an ultra-fast, privacy-first browser history search engine.

CONCEPT & PHILOSOPHY:
- Smruti (स्मृति) = Sanskrit for "memory"
- Cortex = Brain's intelligence center
- Core purpose: Instant memory recall, like "Everything" search for browsers
- Values: Minimalism, Privacy, Speed, Intelligence

VISUAL METAPHOR:
Combine these elements into a single, recognizable icon:
1. Brain/neural network (memory/intelligence)
2. Search/magnifying glass (discovery)
3. Lightning bolt (speed < 50ms)
4. Lock/shield (privacy-first, local-only)

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Style: Modern, flat design, minimal, geometric
- Must work at 16x16px (clear even when tiny)
- Recognizable in grayscale
- No text/words in icon
- Single focal point (brain OR search, not both cluttered)

COLOR PALETTE:
Primary: Deep blue (#3b82f6) - trust, intelligence
Secondary: Purple (#8b5cf6) - creativity, memory
Accent: Electric cyan (#06b6d4) - speed, technology
Background: White or transparent

DELIVERABLES (all PNG format):
1. icon-16.png (16x16px) - Toolbar icon, simplest version
2. icon-48.png (48x48px) - Extension management page
3. icon-128.png (128x128px) - Chrome Web Store tile

SUGGESTED CONCEPTS (choose one):
A) Minimalist brain outline with search dot/pin inside
B) Neural network nodes forming a magnifying glass shape
C) Geometric brain made of interconnected search circles
D) Lightning bolt integrated into brain cortex folds
E) Abstract "memory chip" with search rays

REFERENCE STYLE:
Similar to: Notion (clean), Linear (geometric), Arc Browser (modern)
Avoid: Overly detailed, gradient-heavy, corporate stock imagery

TECHNICAL SPECS:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Color depth: 32-bit RGBA
- Compression: Optimized for web
- Background: Transparent preferred, white acceptable
- Edge treatment: 2px padding from canvas edge

OUTPUT:
Generate 3 sizes (16x, 48x, 128x) of the same icon design scaled appropriately, with details simplified at smaller sizes.
